        <h1>Ghana Naming Culture</h1>
        <p class="graph" >Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 
                'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person. <br>
                Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name.</p>
